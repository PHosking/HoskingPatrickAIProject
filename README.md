# Patrick Hosking's AI Project
A basic AI project demonstrating four basic pathfinding algorithms.

This project is by no means perfect, and there are many things that could change for the better. I tried to be thorough with the documentation, however it could probably be more verbose in some areas and less so in others.

If you find any issues in this project, please put an issue in, and I'll update it whenever I have time.

Feel free to use this project for whatever you may need, however attribution is always encouraged!
